# Pilot Usability Testing â€” FamilyWall
Jay Jay Phoemphoolsinchai | DGT HUM 110 | Spring 2023

## Introduction
FamilyWall describes itself as a family organizer app that includes shared calendars, lists, meal planners, and more. This allows families to stay connected with each other through the use of Circles. A Circle is a grouping in FamilyWall that allows things to be shared between each other. For example, one member of a Circle could make an event on the calendar, and everyone else in the same Circle would also see it and be able to interact with it. This applies to everything on the app, such as lists or budgeting.

## Purposes of Usability Testing and Reasoning
Usability testing is a process to see how usable an application is and highlight any flaws that may be present. They involve participants being guided in sessions that may involve performing particular tasks. The behavior, performance, and results of the participants are valuable data points that could be carefully analyzed and used to help improve usability. For this particular test, FamilyWall is the application being tested. In my review of the usability of the app using the 10 Heuristics, most of the problems I found with usability mainly revolved around things being unclear and unintuitive.

## Methodology

The FamilyWall app will be downloaded onto the participant's phone. Then, they will make an account and sign in. This will be done before the pilot test officially "starts" since the pilot test aims to focus on things other than the signing up process; this way, the participant can immediately start on the tasks given. The recording will start shortly followed by the start of the form. Note that the participant did not want to have the webcam on. After all the sections in the form before the demographic section are done, the recording will be stopped to allow the participant to fill in the rest of the form. The recording has two windows: a window containing the form and another window containing the phone screen. The recording was conducted using Zoom and the [`scrcpy`](https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy) library was used to show the phone screen on the computer screen.

## Pilot Test Reflection
### Learnings
From the pilot test, some of my concerns turned out to not be unfounded. Certain actions that I found to be unintuitive and unclear also proved to be the same case with the participant. I also learned that I didn't seem to miss anything in the heuristic review; all other components seemed to be fine, with only unclearness being a prominent issue when the participant was performing the tasks.
### Positives & Future Improvements
The pilot test went pretty smoothly. There were a few hiccups, however. One hiccup was having the phone screen suddenly disappear, but that was quickly resolved by relaunching the program. Another hiccup was having the Google form seemingly unable to be interacted with, but that was also quickly resolved by refreshing the page. In the future, these issues would try to be avoided, but it would be difficult without having attemped the test first. Thus for a *pilot* test, these issues are fine, but for a normal test, it would have a detrimental effect on the test. Other than that, I feel like I did a good job of explaining to the participant what needed to be done, without giving anything away or saying anything that would significantly affect their thought process. However, I also learned that I should try to make my tasks more specific if possible. If too ambigious, the task being done could diverge from what I was trying to test.
