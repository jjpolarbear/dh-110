# Persona + Scenario

## Purpose of UX Storytelling
> The purpose of UX storytelling is to see everything from a potential user's perspective. This essentially is stepping into their shoes, and viewing everything from that angle, instead of the angle of the designer. It forces the designer to think like a user, feel like a user, and become a user. Since it is natural for people to center experiences on themselves, by having designers replace themselves with users, this creates an accessible way of crafting a truly user-centered experience. Done properly, the designer should be able to experience first-hand each step that an actual user would take.

## FamJam Primary Design Features, Target Functionality
* **Interactive, shared family timeline:** Individuals can make posts consisting of one or more features, including but not limited to photos, videos, music, and text. For example, someone could simply make a text post and have that be put on a timeline. Someone else could add a post with background music, a set of photos, and a text caption. The possibilities will be (nearly) limitless. It would even be possible to add a set of photos with a recipe-specific text format, for example. This allows people to express themselves and connect with others in the way they want to. The goal is for people to be able to connect with their families in a way such that the app doesn't become a bottleneck.
* **Games:** These will primarily be turn-based games, such that it's not necessary to sit down for long periods of time. This way, one person could make a move, and then the other could do so whenever. These will be fully documented such that you can see a visualization of the replay of the game, and the game will also be put on the timeline.

## Scenario 1 + Journey Map 1 (**Henry**)
### Why Henry wanted to use this app
> Henry's company is in the middle of one of their biggest discussions of the year. It turns out that he will have to go overseas for an extended period of time, leaving his wife and his youngest child, his son, back home alone. He is worried that with his absence, the environment at home will be relatively lonely, especially if it is known that he will be gone for a while. Furthermore, with him being overseas, the family will be the most spread apart as it has ever been, further exacerbating his anxiety.

> He starts to think about ways with which he could keep connected with his family. It would have to be something that everyone would have the capability to use. He especially thought about the idea of games, since he knows with his experience as a director that playing games are a great way to get a team to bond and become more connected with each other. In this case, the team would be his family.


### How Henry successfully accomplished this goal with this app
> Henry discovers an app called FamJam. He sees that it features an interactive family timeline, allowing for family members to connect with one another and see what's happening in each other lives. However, he takes note of a feature to play games together. This aligns perfectly with his goal of finding ways to play games with the rest of his family members. He decides to give it a try, sharing a link to the app in his family group chat and saying that they should all download the app and join his "family".

> Once he's set up his "family" and everyone has joined, he lets everyone know about the ability to play games. Everyone also slowly gets used to using the app and posting. Once he's overseas, he decides to start up a game with his son. He presses the "Play" button in the bottom right, next to a gaming controller icon, and a modal window shows up, prompting him as to which game he wants to play. He loves more nuanced games, so he decides to pick Chess. However, there were also other games such as Tic-Tac-Toe and Connect 4. Then, he's prompted to select who he wants to play against, and he uses his finger to scroll the list until he sees a list item with his son's name on it. He presses it and the app tells him using a toast that his son was invited to his game. He is prompted to make the first move and decides on 1. e4, the King's Pawn Opening. Once his son accepts the invitation, Henry makes moves whenever he has a chance to and his son responds. Eventually, the game ends in a loss for him. However, even though he lost in Chess, he doesn't feel like he lost at all, but rather won by feeling a great sense of satisfaction and connection with his son.

## Scenario 2 + Journey Map 2 (**Destiny**)
### Why Destiny wanted to use this app
> As school continually ramps up, Destiny has had to dedicate more and more of her time towards her work, resulting in less time available to keep in touch with her parents. Her periods of homesickness last longer and affect her more, so she decides to try something new other than text messaging and calls. Text messaging, phone calls, and the occasional video calls were sufficient to remedy her feelings of homesickness back when college first started, but now that it's the middle of the school year and classes have started to increase in both workload and difficulty, her feelings of homesickness remain after doing those activities. 

> After thinking, she decides to try to find a way to connect with her family in a more detailed fashion. Her hope was that she would be able to find a mobile application, so that she could use it on-the-go, and also something that wouldn't force her to spend more time than she could afford to. It would also be great if it was something she could do in spurts. 

### How Destiny successfully accomplished this goal with this app
> She decides to look on her phone's application store and finds an app called FamJam. Intrigued by the name and the premise of a shared family timeline, she downloads the app and sets it up, inviting her parents through the "Invite" feature. She calls them about it and tells them how to use it.

> Throughout the day, she can occasionally spare a few minutes to post something or see what her parents have posted. One particular instance, she doesn't have time to post anything, but wants to see what her parents have been up to. She opens the app and sees the timeline, using her finger to scroll the timeline until she gets to where she last saw it. She feels a smile start to bloom on her face, seeing what her mom and dad have been up to, the music accompanying her mom's latest post filling her ears.

## Reflection
* While it was easy enough and even a little fun to come up with the personas, the scenarios were definitely a toughie in comparison. It was a little challenging to try to truly embed key characteristics of the personas into the scenarios and also to format it in a journey map.
* Throughout the process, I learned quite a bit about how I should structure the app and what the user expects. I was able to tweak things from my original vision while creating the scenarios and thinking about how that specific persona would (want to) do things.
* Overall, this definitely was a rewarding process and I can see how it is a valuable tool when it comes to UX.
