# Contextual Inquiry
Jay Jay Phoemphoolsinchai | DGT HUM 110 | Spring 2023

## Step 1: Specify the research goal & requirements
### **What is the main activity your project would support for the users?**
The main activity that my project would support for the users is the ability to share what is going on in their lives with their family members. They would be able to share music, photos, videos, simple text updates, or anything they want to with their family members. This would allow them to stay connected with one another through whichever method they want to use.

### **What is the basic goal/need involved for that activity?**
The basic goal/need involved for this activity is connection and communication. Assuming one has a good relationship with their family, being able to stay connected with family members and be in constant communication is a valuable thing to have.

### **What is(are) the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?**
The traditional/current solutions to satisfy the needs primarily revolve around some form of group messaging. This project aims to transcend the idea of group messaging to make something similar to a family-only social network. Calls and regular social networks are also some current solutions.

### **What is(are) the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved?**
A big limit of social networks is that even if you set your profile to private, it isn't truly private. Others can still view your profile, your username, your photo, and so on. This project would establish something similar to a social network, but exclusive to family members. Calls are also dependent on people having overlapping free time, and don't quite capture the full context of the day. Messaging is similar. By creating a visual, family-wide timeline, this project can help family members capture what other people in their family do during the entire day and allow them to express their emotions.

## Step 2: Target users
### **What are the characteristics of users?**
- Demographics: Individuals who are part of a family whose members do not live at the same location.
- Preference: Individuals who value the connection they have with their family and continually work on their bond with other family members. Individuals should also be willing to share (part of) their lives with their family members.
- Expertise: Any individual. A level of expertise is not required to be a target user.
- Mainstream versus Extreme: A target user can fall into any of these categories.

### **In which context would the users do that activity?**
- Where: Anywhere the users have access to a device with internet.
- Why: The users want to keep in touch with their family and share a part of their lives.
- Under which conditions: The users actively want to share something and have time to do so.

### **What would the users usually do in order to complete that activity?**
The users would usually utilize group messaging or make a call to family members. They may also decide to make a post on a social media network.

## Step 3: Pick an qualitative research method
### **Participatory Observation**
Participatory observation is the chosen qualitative research method.

## Step 4: Plan the details
The interview would be conducted over Zoom, with recording. There would be different types of questions, with example scenario tasks given in the middle. Please see the script linked below to see more detail.

### Interview Key Insights
**What are some factors that you consider when choosing how to connect with family members that don’t live with you?**
> Well a phone call is definitely more instant like if I want to contact them for a specific reason. If it's urgent or something, i'll definitely go for a phone call more than just texting.

> It just depends the reason mostly why I need to get in contact with them. If it's like just planning an event that I probably text message rather than phone call because it's not as urgent. But if it's like sensitive family information or something more emotional? I would definitely go for a phone call over a text message.

**What is the most difficult part of trying to connect with family members that don’t live with you?**
> A lot of it is definitely from being busy at the time that you're free, and then you being busy at the times where they're free.

> It could be also like connection issues because some of my family members live somewhere where the Wi-Fi is not great. So even trying to do like video calls and stuff doesn't work sometimes because the connection is so bad or like it's very pixelated. The audio is bad, like I can barely hear them.

## Step 6: Reflection
Overall, the contextual inquiry feels like it went pretty well. I was able to gain insight on what a target user would want and how they think things through. The contextual inquiry process felt more of a discussion than the usability testing process. For usability testing, it seemed to be a very one-sided conversation, with one person moderating and the other person following the instructions. With this, I was able to have a discussion with a back-and-forth that was missing from the usability testing process. However, I am not sure if this is because of my inexperience of usability testing or if this is how it should normally go. Additionally, I could use some more practice conducting interviews since now that I look back at it, there were missed opportunities to ask follow-up questions or utilize the participant's unique background to gain more specific insights.
