## Purpose of High Fidelity Prototype

* The purpose of producing a high fidelity prototype is multifaceted. A great reason to do so is to test the functionality of the product. Often times, it can be hard to truly test the functionality of a product without actually making the functionality. A high fidelity prototype allows one to closely mimic the final product's functionality without actually making the final product, so that it can be tested thoroughly. Additionally, the higher detail present in a high fidelity prototype allows for a more critical examination of the final color scheme, layout, and overall interface elements. Furthermore, a high fidelity prototype can be an important visual for seeing overall what the product will look like and feel like in general, which could be important to find any issues that would only crop up when viewed from a very broad, bird's eye view.

## Description of Project

* An app that allows for members of a family to post updates in a timeline fashion. The posts can be one of many different types: text only, text and pictures, pictures only, text and music, and so on. This would allow members to simply post what they want without needing to follow a strict format.
They would also be able to initiate games with family members.

## Purpose of Project

* For FamJam, the overarching goal is to create a comprehensive timeline for the day with many family members creating interleaving posts, allowing family members that may not live near each other to still remain in close contact with each other and know what is happening in each other's lives. This will help faciliate the upkeep of familial bonds.
